# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview
The program/project is a small interface to utilize AWS/Amazon features of GET, DELETE and PUT in a more user-friendly manner. It boasts a form and a dynamically updating table. The form lets you add items based on their ID, Price, and Name, while the table lets you see all the items, and delete them by row. It has a small CSS portion that is designed to be a popular "dark mode" color scheme and reformats the table, form, and buttons from their basic HTML versions to sleek and rounded variations.

Note: The buttons are kinda... off in my opinion. If i were to update this project further, I would give them effects so the user "feels" when they are pressing them. Right now they feel kinda static and unsatisfying. 
## Usage

Assuming you have the required/intended VSCode Live Preview Server extension, and you are in the project (via cloning, downlaod, etc) simply use ctrl+shift+p (or type ">" in the command bar at the top) then click "Live Server Preview: Start Server". The website is not intended to be used in any other manner.

## Sources and Credits

There wasn't too much I used for outside sources this time around. I used current and previous README's alongside a couple websites mostly pertaining to the CSS portion. 


 - Rounding borders: It was looking a bit off with rectangles, so I looked up how to round borders in css. This showed up first: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp
 - Looked up various places for good colors: https://www.schemecolor.com/powerful-black-and-white-color-palette.php 
 - Note: Only use of CoPilot was asking it for some other hexcodes as well. I used a couple of its suggestions and ran with them. (E.g. using 1e1e1e and 333333 in some form).
 - Xhr reference other than the provided notes: https://dev.to/attacomsian/introduction-to-xmlhttprequest-xhr-142j
 - Checking forms real quick: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
 - Went back in labs to check tables, but also used this: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp



Thank you for your time!
